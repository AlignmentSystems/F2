For information on Version 2 development, [browse to the wiki](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/wiki/Roadmap#f2-v2-discussion).

While there's a [long list of contributors](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/graphs/contributors), the core maintainers of F2 are at [Markit On Demand](http://www.markitondemand.com).

## Get Started Contributing

Be sure you have cloned this repository and have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed, then run the following command from the project root directory:

`$> npm install`

This command will install the [Grunt CLI](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli) and, using [bower](http://bower.io/), all packages needed to work on F2. Depending on your configuration, you may need to be an admin to install some of these Node packages. Additionally, some packages may need to be [installed globally](http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/03/23/npm-1-0-global-vs-local-installation/) using the `-g` switch. If the installation fails due to permissions, use `sudo`.
