# Get Started with F2

<p class="lead">The goal of F2 is to define a development standard for the financial services industry that offers a cost saving, risk-reducing method for building innovative, multi-provider solutions. F2 is open, free and active on GitHub.</p>

F2 is an open and free web integration framework designed to help you and other financial industry participants develop custom solutions that combine the best tools and content from multiple providers into one, privately-labeled, seamlessly integrated front-end. 

## Spec

<p><a class="btn btn-primary" href="app-development.html">Build an F2 App</a> or <a class="btn btn-primary" href="container-development.html">Build an F2 Container</a></p>

## Examples

If you are interested in building apps, get started by [browsing through this technical documentation](app-development.html). If you are interested in building containers, [browse to the container documentation](container-development.html).

## Specification

F2 will continuously evolve to bring the community the best features, services and apps. F2's promise is to do this by building on the existing spec, not by changing it. The specification aims high to solve many problems and suit many needs. As the standard evolves and new requirements come to light, the functionality in F2 will expand accordingly. 

To achieve steady growth and stable release cycles, F2 will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. For more information, [browse to the readme on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2#readme).

## Latest Version

F2 v1.0 was released on October 15, 2012. The latest version of the F2 specification is *{{version}}* released on *{{_releaseDateFormatted}}*. To provide transparency into the future of F2, a roadmap wiki will be available on GitHub. A [changelog](https://github.com/OpenF2/F2/wiki/Docs-Changelog) that tracks version-to-version changes, upgrades and deprecated features will offer a historical look at F2's evolution.
